# Neural Networks are Universal Approximators

![Demo](/demo.gif)

A friend asked me what it meant for neural networks to really "learn," and I had a hard time explaining it to him without a good visualization. I decided to make him one for functions $f: R \rightarrow R$, as I think the Universal Approximation Theorem is the best way to develop an intuiton for what is going on in a neural network at a high level. I hope this is helpful for you too!
